* Streamlining ssh Configuration
> ![image](nanoeditorsshconfig.png)  
First, I got into the .ssh directory by entering `cd ~/.ssh` in the terminal. Then, by entering `nano config`, I used the nano editor to create the config file and add the given entries.

After exiting the nano editor, I successfully logged in with `ssh ieng6`.

I used `scp` command using the alias to copy the file index.html onto my account.  



* Setting up Github Access from ieng6
> ![image](pubkeyongithub.png)  
By entering `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, I copied the public key in the clipboard. Following the tutorial, I added a new ssh key on my Github.

The private and public keys are stored in .ssh directory. The private key is stored in the file id_rsa, while the public one is stored in the file id_rsa.pub.

Now, I cloned my markdown-parser directory on github onto my ieng6 account. After making some change in the file, I commited the change to github from my ieng6 account, which is shown in this [link](https://github.com/qianyunwang/markdown-parser/commit/a5c190c7c3947a2842288bd6c1338e3d3753402c).

Here, I used semicolons to run multiple commands on the same lineâ€”copied markdown-parser onto my ieng6 account and ran the two test files.
